    <h1>History of Encryption</h1>

    <p>
        Encryption has been used for thousands of years to protect messages and secrets. Here's a brief timeline of key developments:
    </p>

    <h2>🔐 Ancient Times</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Caesar Cipher (c. 50 BC)</strong> – Julius Caesar used this simple letter-shifting technique to send military orders securely.</li>
        <li><strong>Scytale Cipher (Ancient Sparta)</strong> – Used a wrapped rod and a strip of parchment to encrypt messages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📜 Middle Ages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vigenère Cipher (1500s)</strong> – A polyalphabetic cipher that was considered unbreakable for centuries.</li>
        <li><strong>Arabic Cryptanalysis</strong> – Scholars like Al-Kindi developed early methods for breaking ciphers through frequency analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>⚙️ 20th Century</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enigma Machine (WWII)</strong> – Used by Nazi Germany, this complex mechanical device encrypted military communications.</li>
        <li><strong>Codebreaking at Bletchley Park</strong> – Alan Turing and others developed early computers to crack Enigma codes, influencing modern computing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🖥️ Modern Era</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Public Key Encryption (1970s)</strong> – RSA and Diffie-Hellman introduced encryption without needing to share keys in advance.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption Today</strong> – AES, HTTPS, end-to-end encrypted messaging (like Signal, WhatsApp) protect billions of users worldwide.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
        Encryption has shaped history, protected lives, and now underpins the internet. Understanding how it evolved helps us understand the digital world we live in.
