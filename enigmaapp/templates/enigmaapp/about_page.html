    <h1>About Encryption</h1>

    <p>
        Encryption is the process of converting readable information into an unreadable format to protect it from unauthorized access.
        It has been used throughout history to keep messages secret, from ancient Rome to modern cybersecurity.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Encryption Matters</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Protects personal data and privacy</li>
        <li>Keeps communication secure</li>
        <li>Prevents unauthorized access to information</li>
        <li>Used in banking, messaging apps, websites, and more</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        This site is designed to help you explore how encryption works. You can:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learn about classic and modern encryption algorithms</li>
        <li>Experiment with simple ciphers like Caesar and substitution</li>
        <li>Understand how the Enigma machine helped shape modern cryptography</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What's Ahead</h2>
    <p>
        We'll add interactive features that let you enter messages, see them encrypted, and even try to decrypt them.
